*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install

```bash
npm run genkit:watch
```
The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:9002` (or the port specified in your `package.json`).
